## Currently Learning
- Advanced machine learning workflows and model evaluation
- Deep learning architectures and transfer learning
- Model deployment & basic MLOps (containers, CI/CD for ML)

## Projects (suggested)
Pin your top projects to your GitHub profile and list them here. Example:
- Project A — short description + tech used
- Project B — short description + tech used
(If you want, I can auto-generate a Projects section listing your top repos.)

## How to reach me
- GitHub: [Umer-prog](https://github.com/Umer-prog)
- Email: add your email here
- LinkedIn / Twitter: add profile links

---

## Tips to improve this README further
1. Pin 3–6 repositories on your GitHub profile (these show on your profile and attract visitors).
2. Add a short screenshot or GIF for one featured project.
3. Add WakaTime or custom contribution/activity badges if you use those services.
4. Add a short "Goals / Roadmap" list (e.g., "Complete X course", "Build Y project").
5. Include contact/social links you want visible.

If you'd like, I can:
- Create a new branch and push this README update, then open a pull request for you.
- Or just provide the raw Markdown file for you to paste into README.md.

Which would you prefer? If you want me to push the change, I'll create a branch named `update/readme-stats` and open a PR — confirm and I'll proceed.
